# System Programing (SPL) BGU - Assignment 1
## Medical Warehouse Management System

## Overview

This project simulates the management of a medical supplies distribution system, developed as part of the SPL Assignment 1 for the Spring 2024 semester. The system manages a central warehouse, assigns volunteers, processes supply requests, and handles deliveries to beneficiaries in a fictional region affected by a natural disaster.

## Purpose of the Assignment

The primary purpose of this assignment is to enhance practical skills in C++ programming by developing an object-oriented system. The assignment focuses on:

- **Object-Oriented Design (OOD)**: Applying principles of OOD to create a robust and maintainable system.
- **Memory Management**: Managing dynamic memory in C++ to prevent leaks and ensure efficiency.
- **Standard Data Structures**: Using standard C++ data structures to manage complex interactions.
- **Rule of Five**: Implementing special member functions to manage resources effectively.

## Skills Used

### Object-Oriented Design (OOD)
- **Class Design**: Creating classes that represent different components of the system, such as `MedicalWarehouse`, `Beneficiary`, and `Volunteer`.
- **Inheritance and Polymorphism**: Using inheritance to define common behaviors and polymorphism to handle different volunteer roles.
- **Encapsulation**: Encapsulating data and exposing functionality through public methods.

### C++ Programming
- **Dynamic Memory Management**: Using pointers and dynamic memory allocation to manage resources.
- **Standard Template Library (STL)**: Utilizing STL containers like `std::vector` to manage collections of data.
- **Rule of Five**: Implementing the destructor, copy constructor, copy assignment operator, move constructor, and move assignment operator to manage resource lifecycles.
